# Cloudinuous Integration

This is a minimalistic, sample repository to test Travis' Continuous Integration and study link and integration between Travis and GitHub.

## How to test

Test will be automatically performed as soon as this repository is linked to Travis.
This GitHub project still needs a .yml file, though, without which no build or test can be performed.

I'll add the .yml descriptor in a further commit to see what's happening meanwhile.
